# Weekly Knowledge Sharing Session Repository

Welcome to our weekly knowledge-sharing session repository! ðŸš€

## About

This repository is dedicated to our weekly knowledge-sharing sessions where we aim to learn and grow together in a collaborative environment. Instead of traditional lectures, we believe in active participation and hands-on learning.

## How It Works

Each week, a new problem statement will be posted in this repository. Everyone is encouraged to participate by solving the problem and submitting a Pull Request (PR) with their solution.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Read the problem statement provided in the repository/{problem-name}.
3. Solve the problem
4. Commit your solution on a PR and push it to this repository.
5. Create a Pull Request (PR) to submit your solution.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Make sure your solution adheres to the problem statement.
- Provide clear documentation and comments in your code.
- Follow best practices and coding standards.
- Submit only one PR per problem statement.

## Code Review

During our weekly knowledge-sharing sessions, we will review the submitted PRs together. This provides an opportunity for constructive feedback, learning from each other's approaches, and improving our problem-solving skills.

## Let's Get Started!

We're excited to embark on this journey of learning and collaboration with you. Stay tuned for the first problem statement and let's solve it together!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
